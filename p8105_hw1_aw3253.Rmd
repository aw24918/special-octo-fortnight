# Problem 1


```{r}

plot_df <- data.frame(
  x <- c(-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  
  y = rnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  
  z =  c("FALSE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE", "TRUE")
  
  
)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
